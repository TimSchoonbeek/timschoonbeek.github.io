  aboutMe:
    "I am Tim Schoonbeek, a PhD candidate at ASML and Eindhoven University of Technology (graduating Nov 2025), where I develop multimodal AI for computer vision and augmented reality in industrial settings. My work spans scalable video understanding, defect detection, and humanâ€“AI collaboration, with multiple patents and publications and experience at industrial research divisions (Microsoft, ASML, Honda). I am passionate about turning cutting-edge research into real-world impact. Outside the lab, I am usually on (or tinkering with) a motorcycle, or learning Portuguese.",
